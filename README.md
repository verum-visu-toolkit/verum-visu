# verum visu toolkit

**verum visu** (Latin for *true to see*) is a project applying modular design
to the process of audio visualization, allowing for fully customizable, rich
visualizations that can utilize multiple languages or applications.

The **verum visu Toolkit** defines audio visualization as a process using three pieces of software:

1. *Spectral Analyzer*\
    analyzes audio for frequency data

2. **Visualizer**

3. *Video Renderer*\
    creates a video file by the frames

The *Spectral Analyzer* and *Video Renderer* are the tools in the
toolkit. The Visualizer is a step created by *you* or someone else in the
**verum visu community**, and that is what actually defines the relationship between
the audio and the visuals.

### Visualizer
The Visualizer is actually two applications:

1. **Interpreter**\
    creates visualization data from the frequency data as input (using algorithms
    /neural networks)

2. **Director**\
	creates draw commands from the visualization data as input


<!-- 2. **Graphics**\
    (JSON) file which configures how visualization data should be mapped to properties of
    shapes for the renderer to animate -->

The Interpreter could be written in any language&mdash;it just needs to be able to read and
write JSON files.

<!-- for now (8.26.17), if it's written in Python, you can use vv-sptfile and/or vv-fmsfile -->

This toolkit exists so that you can experiment with audio visualization without
paying any attention to the technical aspects of spectral analysis and video rendering.
It allows you to streamline the process of visualization since you only need to create a
Visualizer, which defines everything about your visualization.

<!-- For more low-level control of the visualization of frames data, you can specify a **Frame Generator**,
a Python file that draws shapes for each frame. Frames data can also be generated by an Interpreted
as JSON, so you can create your own renderer in a language other than Python. -->

TODO: publish the packages
(the tools and Visualizer parts should reference the appropriate file formats
directly)
TODO: create vvfmsfile and impl it in vvrenderer

TODO: put my personal visualizer process in a public repo


in this file, also write more about the ideas of the project -
the repo will pretty much be the project home page (in the OSS community)
